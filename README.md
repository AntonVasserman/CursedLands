# CursedLands
This is a Repository for Cursed Lands, a 3rd-Person, RPG, Open-World portfolio piece project in Unreal Engine.

This project setup is inspired by [_Evil Islands: Curse of the Lost Soul_]((https://en.nival.com/games/pc-games/evil-islands)), a Top Down RPG PC game by [_Nival Interactive_](https://en.nival.com/) and by other RPGs and Open World games.

This project's purpose is to serve as a portfolio piece, showcasing experience in the next areas and systems:
* Gameplay Ability System
* State Trees for AI (TODO)
* Advanced Locomotion System (TODO)
* Gameplay Camera System (TODO)
* TODO...

The project is also inspired by the next Stephen Ulibarri's Udemy courses:
* [Unreal Engine 5 C++ The Ultimate Game Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course)
* [Unreal Engine 5 - Gameplay Ability System - Top Down RPG](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-gas-top-down-rpg/)
